# GATNM : Graph with Attention Neural Network Model for Mycobacterial Cell Wall Permeability of Drugs and Drug-like Compounds
We developed GATNM as a proposed model for the mycobacterial tuberculosis cell wall permeability of drugs. This model is based on the graph attention neural network model complemented by the fully connected neural network as a classification layer. Before we got GATNM, we had carried out some experiments using many different models. All the codes arranged sequentially in these folders, were used when our experiments were conducted. Three experiments that we ran consisted of machine learning, deep learning, and graph with attention neural network experiments.

# Manual 
We coded the model using the Jupyter Notebook platform. All the models were created based on the Pytorch and some data features were generated by using RDkit library packages. 
The environment was set by Anaconda and it can be seen in the **environment.txt** file. 
The dataset is also provided in **all_dataset_mtbpen5371.csv**
